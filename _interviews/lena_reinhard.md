__[Q] Is this your first trip to Melbourne? Or Australia? Do you have other plans for your trip?__
This is my first trip to Melbourne, and my first trip to Australia. My biggest plans so far are 1. getting this super long flight from Berlin to Melbourne over with and not being a complete wreck afterwards, 2. having ALL THE COFFEE in Melbourne, 3. seeing a Wombat, 4. keeping myself from saying “‘straya”.

__[Q] Tell us a bit about yourself and what you do.__
I’m a Team Lead at Travis CI, where I lead a team of 12 wonderful people. I have an interdisciplinary background, and have been working in sectors like media and finance before getting into tech 7 years ago. On the side, I work as a writer and photographer. And two years ago, I got into public speaking.

__[Q] What does your usual work day look like?__
I usually get up around 7:30, get ready and have a small breakfast. Around 3 times a week, I then get to our office on the subway (via my favourite coffee place), which takes around 45 minutes (the other days I work from home). Then I start my day by catching up on emails and Slack messages from last night, and using the quiet time to work on some things that I need extended focus time for.

At 10am, I usually have my first meeting, often a 1:1 with one of the people in my team. On average, I have about 4 planned meetings every day, e.g. either 1:1s, planning meetings, or exchange with other Team Leads. Between meetings, I finish notes, follow up on tasks, write or give feedback on documents, comment on tickets, answer questions in our chat, prepare other meetings, add tasks to my todo list, or check in with people. In the hour before the end of my work day, I usually update my todo list and prepare my upcoming meetings on the next days, send out agendas, or go heads-down for focussing on documents. And in between all of this, I usually have more coffee, of course.

__[Q] Clearly, you’ve reached a certain point in your career (because you’re with us!), where do you aspire to get to from here?__
Above all things, I want to become a better leader – especially with regard to fostering inclusive, safe environments for diverse groups of people, and taking good care of them. Working with humans is a field that fascinates me, even more so since it’s both ever-changing, and at the same time, many of the underlying dynamics are so often related with very basic human needs.

__[Q] What was the best non-tech job you have ever had?__
I worked as a Barista for some time, which was super cool, but really difficult with regard to the caffeine dose I got my body used to (I stopped drinking coffee for a year after I quit that job). Even cooler though: For more than a year, I worked as a car journalist on the side. I got to drive some amazing classic cars (once even in the UK, which meant driving a very expensive car on the “wrong side of the street” (at least that’s what it felt like), which was a super frightening experience). And I got to do one of the best road trips I’ll probably ever do in my lifetime.

__[Q] If you didn't work on the Web, what would you be doing?__
I’d either be a photographer or photo journalist, or would’ve written my first novel by now, or I’d be the very proud owner of an Alpaca farm, and take selfies with Alpacas every day.
