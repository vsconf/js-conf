__[Q] Do you sky-dive, knit, play the banjo, cycle or do anything that isn't on a computer?__

I like to walk, paint nails, sew, watch BBC history documentaries. I live in Portland, Oregon now so there is also a fair bit of camping and hiking I'm doing these days as well.

__[Q] If money and time were no object, what would you be doing right now?__

Easy! I'd hire all the awesome women I know (and don't know!), form a super group to dismantle the current system (since money is power and all).

__[Q] Tell us about the journey that led you to what you're doing?__

I went to school for and worked as an urban designer/architect and fell into open source when I took a year to do the Code for America fellowship. I wanted to make technology better within government as well as use it to make government more accessible to people. At the end of the year the call of open source and sharing knowledge was too strong for me to go right back into urban design. Luckily I'd learned a bit of JavaScript during that year and was able to get a job in tech which then became working on open source as my job, which was great. I'm at the point now where it's been a few years and I wonder how I might bridge the gap of my two careers in urban design and web development.

__[Q] If you could have any question answered, what would it be?__

It would be, what question should I ask? Because I get immobilized by decisions a lot of of the time.

__[Q] Who should we be following on Twitter?__

["@muanchoi"](http://twitter.com/muanchoi), ["@notwaldorf"](http://twitter.com/notwaldorf), ["@fox"](http://twitter.com/fox), ["@aminatou"](http://twitter.com/aminatou), ["@presentandcorrect"](http://twitter.com/presentandcorrect) â€¦ but I also think this depends on who you are-follow some folks that don't look like you.
