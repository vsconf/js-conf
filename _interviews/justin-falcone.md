__[Q] Clearly, you've reached a certain point in your career (because you're with us!), where do you aspire to get to from here?__

You know Shingy, Aol's 'digital prophet?' That's my goal.

__[Q] Do you skydive, knit, play the banjo, cycle or do anything that isn't on a computer?__

I'm a hardcore karaoke enthusiast - so much so that I host a podcast about it, called [Karaoke Theory](http://karaoketheory.com/).

__[Q] Tell us about the journey that led you to what you're doing.__

About five years ago I moved from Boston to New York City, mostly because of peer pressure. I had spent the previous five years working at Walgreens; my greatest ambition was that in NYC I might get to work at the Apple Store. Instead, through a combination of luck, connections and privilege I ended up working part time as a general purpose technologist/"social media guru"; my primary qualification being that I spent an awful lot of time on twitter. I was actually pretty bad at social media - I always felt like I was bothering people - but I was able to pick up the tech side pretty well. Between my background in geocities-era web development, some high school CS classes, and why's Poignant Guide to Ruby, I was able to fake my through a series of progressively more-legitimate tech jobs until I became the Thought Leader I am today.

__[Q] Who should we be following on Twitter?__
