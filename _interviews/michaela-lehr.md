__[Q] Tell us a bit about yourself and what you do?__

Sure. I am Michaela, a frontend developer and UX designer from Berlin, Germany. Five years ago, I co-founded a web development studio with my partner. It's called [GeilDanke](https://geildanke.com "GeilDanke Developlment Studio"), which is German for "Awesome, thanks!". Since then we work on web applications and hybrid apps for clients and [customers](https://geomiii.geildanke.com "geomiii on GeilDanke"). What I really love about my work is the freedom to choose what I want to work on next. The freedom to learn new things, experimenting and even failing, is what I prefer about being independent.

__[Q] Is this your first trip to Melbourne? Or Australia? Do you have other plans for your trip?__

Yes. It's my first trip to Australia and my first trip to the southern hemisphere. That's why I am planning to stay in Australia until the end of December and to visit not only Melbourne, but also Cairns, the Gold Coast and Sydney. I am really looking forward to the trip and the conference. I think both - conference and trip - will be the best and most exciting experience I had in a long time.

__[Q] Do you skydive, knit, play the banjo, cycle or do anything that isnâ€™t on a computer?__

Yes ðŸ˜Š I [knit](https://mobile.twitter.com/FischaelaMeer/status/647460564055277568), [hike](https://mobile.twitter.com/FischaelaMeer/status/663118178281791488), and practice Yoga. I used to play the [harp](https://mobile.twitter.com/FischaelaMeer/status/780822114131664896), but I stopped playing it for almost ten years and I just started to exercise again. And before I forget: Last year, when I lived on the Canaries for some months, I started to learn [surfing](https://mobile.twitter.com/FischaelaMeer/status/672889623413157888). I am not very good, but I really liked it and am really looking forward to start doing it again. Maybe I'll get the chance in Australia at the end of the year.

__[Q] What was the best non-tech job you have ever had?__

I used to work as an editor for a gaming magazine. I know now, that writing isn't something I could do for the rest of my life, but playing games and writing about them was really fun for some years.

__[Q] What can't you wait for browsers to support?__

You probably guessed it already: I cannot wait for browsers to support the APIs and features needed to run VR applications.
