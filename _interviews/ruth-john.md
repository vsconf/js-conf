__[Q] Tell us a bit about yourself and what you do.__

I’m always a bit thrown by questions like this. I left my job a few months ago to take some time off, travel and figure out what to do next. So at the moment I don’t have a strict answer such as ‘I am this person who does this thing’. I’m just a causal front end dev/designer and just came from a job in R&D. I’m looking to work more in the art/music space come new year, when I’ve finished this stint of traveling. Ask me this again in 6 months and you’ll get a whole different answer!

__[Q] Is this your first trip to Melbourne? Or Australia? Do you have other plans for your trip?__

This is my first trip to Australia. I’m really looking forward to it, especially visiting Melbourne. I’m going to be staying around for a month afterwards. My best friend lives in Perth and we’re going to drive around Australia, finding adventures!

__[Q] No spoilers, but what’s one thing you hope the audience will take away from your talk?__

Not only am I talking, but our { Live : JS } collective is performing at the after party and we’re going to be showing off some of the things we’ve built at Decompress, so with that in mind I think the one thing I would like people to take away from all of that is that the web can be what you make it. It’s such an incredible platform.

__[Q] Do you skydive, knit, play the banjo, cycle or do anything that isn’t on a computer?__

I do loads of practical things. My whole downstairs is a dedicated studio space. My sewing machine, electric piano, easel are all within chair rolling distance… I also have an Etsy shop where I sell crochet patterns I create.

__[Q] If there was one thing you wish you could be working on, what would it be? (this could be something you are working on, if you like!)__

My in browser VJ Software (Vizra) - I never seem to have enough time for that at the moment, even with my time off! There’s also a couple of other personal projects which I’ve started since I left my job which I’d just like to give a little more time to and get deployed. Maybe after I’ve adventured in Australia!
