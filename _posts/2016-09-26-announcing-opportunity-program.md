At JSConf AU we're dedicated to diversity, inclusion and even more so—**opportunity**. We realise that buying a ticket to a conference for many isn't a trivial expense, but it can be a turning point in someone's career. 

We're committed to bringing in as many individuals who couldn't attend otherwise as possible. We want you to feel like you belong. We want to build a lasting, inclusive, safe community. As organisers we see it as our  responsibility to help diversify the face of the Australian tech industry. 

It's our pleasure to announce the Opportunity Program providing free passes to JSConf AU 2016. Read along for eligibility requirements, application close an notification dates.

## Eligibility
Applicants for a free Opportunity Program ticket have to 
fulfill at least one of the below requirements:

- be a member of an underrepresented group in tech, such as women, LGBTI+, African-American, Indigenous Australians, Latina or Latino, people with disabilities or other groups not mentioned here
- be unable to attend without financial assistance

It's important to remember that:

- Previous conference attendance doesn't disqualify an application
- No technology experience or knowledge is required—we're here to learn!
- Yes, you deserve it ✨
