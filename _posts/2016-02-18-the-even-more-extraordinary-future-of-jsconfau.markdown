It's been almost two years since the last JSConf AU, and that's two events in four years. Despite our rocky start, each event has seen growth. We've grown in size, and our community has grown with us. We've grown local speakers that have graced World stages, and have matched the efforts of the industry luminaries they rubbed shoulders with. And from the very beginning, we were optimisitic of the positive impact that our work would have on the local community. A belief that's been reinforced time and again by attendees, volunteers, and speakers—and has kept us pushing forward. We are committed to building and sustainably growing the Australian tech community.

As a part of the [JSConf family](http://jsconf.com/), JSConf AU is a not-for-profit labour-of-love. It goes without saying that running an event at this scale requires a lot of commitment and effort from everyone involved. Our team work tirelessly over many months, donating their time and even taking a break from paid work, to create not only the best experience, but to also foster a safe environment.

## Reconstructing JSConfAU

## Call for Sponsorships

We are well aware that conferences of this size can't succeed without the efforts of the community, both local and international. Together, we can meet our aim of a memorable, inclusive experience—an opportunity to learn and connect. If your company would like to support us in doing so, [contact us for details](mailto:sponsors@jsconfau.com)

(You'll be in good company, just [take a look at the great sponsors from our last event](http://2014.jsconfau.com/#Sponsor)).

And for those of you who can't help financially—spreading the word about all our events would mean the world to us.

## Super Early Bird Tickets

And for you, dear attendees, **limited early bird tickets are available**, including a discounted ticket bundle for our events. We’d love to see you there.
